# ToDo List ‚úîÔ∏è

#### A simple To-Do App üì± built to demonstrate the use of modern android architecture component with MVVM Architecture üèó

### Build With üèóÔ∏è
- [Kotlin] - Programming language for Android
- [Hilt-Dagger] - Standard library to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- [Room] - SQLite object mapping library.
- [Coroutines] - For asynchronous
- [Flow] - A flow is an asynchronous version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.
- [LiveData] - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
- [ViewModel] - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
- [ViewBinding] - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [DataStore] - Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
- [Jetpack Navigation] - Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app

### Project Architecture üóº

This app uses [MVVM (Model View View-Model)] architecture.
